I've known about arithmetic and geometric means (arithmetic being the most common, and geometric being the nth root of the product x1*x2*...*xn), and median for a while, and I was curious about what would happen if I made a single function to run all of them and return that as an array, allowing you to call that function on its own results over and over until they center on a single value. So that's what this is, after I had those set up I researched some more means and added them as well, took a little bit of time to generalize it so I can add as many methods as I'd like in the future without having to edit any of the functions I have now, just adding it to the list.

I would like to try breaking each function up into an object that has functions within for things that run before (like finding a min/max), on every number (like adding or multiplying them), and at the end (like dividing or taking the nth root), that way instead of having to loop through for every mean method separately, I can call their partial functions as I run through the values twice (for the preprocessing and processing), and then their final part (again, that'd be something like dividing by n), cutting the run time down by a factor of however many functions I have. All of the functions are linear though so this will only save a constant amount of time, but it's still an interesting challenge.
