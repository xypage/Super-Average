I've known about arithmetic and geometric means (arithmetic being the most common, and geometric being the nth root of the product x1\*x2\*...\*xn), and median for a while, and I was curious about what would happen if I made a single function to run all of them and return that as an array, allowing you to call that function on its own results over and over until they center on a single value. So that's what this is, after I had those set up I researched some more means and added them as well, took a little bit of time to generalize it so I can add as many methods as I'd like in the future without having to edit any of the functions I have now, just adding it to the list.

Now that I've allowed them to run sort of in parallel, my next goal is to study up on python because the way I did it feels very clunky. Going to rethink the setup of my list that I use to access them as well, because right now remaking the objects over and over feels like it must have some unnecessary overhead, although there's overhead no matter what because I'm not just using functions I'm using data structures that remember the values they've got, even if it is just a couple floats each.
